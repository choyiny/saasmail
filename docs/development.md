# Local development

```bash
# Start dev server (frontend + worker)
yarn dev

# Run tests
yarn test

# Type-check
yarn tsc --noEmit

# Generate a migration after schema changes
yarn db:generate

# Apply migrations locally
yarn db:migrate:dev

# Seed the local database with mock inboxes, people, and email threads
yarn db:seed:dev

# Open Drizzle Studio (local)
yarn db:studio:dev
```

Since Cloudflare Email Routing can't deliver to `wrangler dev`, the seed script populates `seeds/demo.sql` so you can exercise the inbox UI without real inbound email.

## API explorer

The API is generated from Zod schemas in `worker/src/routers/`. Each running worker exposes an OpenAPI 3.0 spec at `/doc` (JSON) and an interactive explorer at `/swagger-ui`. Both are public — no auth required to read the spec.

## End-to-end tests

Playwright drives the UI against a local `vite dev` running in demo mode (port 8788).

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first run only)
yarn playwright install chromium

# Run the full E2E suite (wipes and re-seeds the local D1 first)
yarn test:e2e

# Interactive runner
yarn test:e2e:ui

# Debug a single spec
yarn test:e2e e2e/specs/compose.spec.ts
```

The E2E suite **wipes and re-seeds the local D1 database** (`.wrangler/state/v3/d1/`) every time it runs. If you have hand-seeded dev data you want to keep, re-run `yarn db:seed:dev` after the E2E suite finishes.

Requirements in `.dev.vars`: `DEMO_MODE=1` and `DISABLE_PASSKEY_GATE=true` — both are in `.dev.vars.example`. The suite also expects `http://localhost:8788` in `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in `wrangler.jsonc`.
